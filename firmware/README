README for the focuser firmware project
---------------------------------------

Since the firmware reads the serial number from eeprom, it is necessary
to write the eeprom after flashing the device. The "make flash" command
is supposed to do that. But the serial number will then be 0000000. Use
the "serial" command of the fclient programm to set the serial number.
